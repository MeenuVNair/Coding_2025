Structural Pattern
-----------------------

Structural design patterns are concerned with the composition of classes and objects.
They focus on how to assemble classes and objects into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.


Adapter Pattern
====================

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a translator or wrapper around an existing class.
It converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

It acts as a bridge between the Target interface (expected by the client) and the Adaptee (an existing class with a different interface).
This structural wrapping enables integration and compatibility across diverse systems.

Real Product Use Cases
------------------------
The Adapter Pattern is not just a theoretical concept â€” it plays a crucial role in real-world software products and systems.
Many enterprise-level applications rely on this pattern to integrate with third-party tools, legacy systems, and platform-specific APIs.
Below are some common and impactful use cases:

1. Payment Gateways
    Scenario:
        Different payment providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe, Razorpay, PayU) expose their own APIs with varying method names, parameters, and response formats.
    Adapter Use:
        By implementing a common PaymentGateway interface and creating adapters for each provider, businesses can switch or support multiple gateways without rewriting business logic.
        This decouples the checkout flow from provider-specific implementations.

2. Logging Frameworks
    Scenario:
        Enterprise applications often need to support different logging libraries like Log4j, SLF4J, or custom logging solutions.
    Adapter Use:
        An adapter can unify the logging interface so developers can write log.debug(...), regardless of whether the underlying implementation is Log4j or java.util.logging.
        This makes it easier to switch or support multiple logging backends with minimal changes.

3. Cloud Providers and SDKs
    Scenario:
        Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer similar functionalities (storage, compute, database) but expose them through different SDKs and APIs.
    Adapter Use:
        Using an adapter layer, developers can abstract cloud operations behind a common interface, enabling them to change providers (e.g., from AWS S3 to Google Cloud Storage) without impacting the rest of the application.
        This is particularly useful for hybrid-cloud or multi-cloud strategies.
