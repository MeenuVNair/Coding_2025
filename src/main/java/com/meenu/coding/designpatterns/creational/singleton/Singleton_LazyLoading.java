/*******  APPROACH ******************** 
 In Lazy Loading, the Singleton instance is created only when it's needed â€” the first time the getInstance() method is called.

 The instance starts as null.
 It is only created when getInstance() is first called.
 Future calls return the already created instance.

 Pros
 -------
 Saves memory if the instance is never used.
 Object creation is deferred until required.

 Cons
 --------
 Lazy Loading is Not thread-safe by default. Thus, it requires synchronization in multi-threaded environments.

    private Singleton_LazyLoading() {}  // private constructor. Declaring it private prevents creation of its object using the new keyword
