/**** COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ******************** 
 Time Complexity:O(n) because the while loop iterates at most n/2 times, where n is the length of the array.
 Space Complexity:O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like i, j, and temp, regardless of the input array size.

/*******  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ******************** 
 ay [1,2,1,1,5,1] is [1,5,1,1,2,1].

 Input: n=3, arr = [1,2,1]

 Output:
 [2,1,2]
 [1,2,1]
 [1,1,2]
 [2,1,1]
 ðŸŽ‰ Correct! Youâ€™ve earned 10 points!
 Constraints:
 1 <= n <= 104

 1 <= arr[i] <= 105
