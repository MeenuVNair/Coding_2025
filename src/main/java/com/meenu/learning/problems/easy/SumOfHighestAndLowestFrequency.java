/**** COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ********************
 Time Complexity:O(n) because the code iterates through the input array once to build the frequency map and then iterates through the map, which in the worst case can have n distinct elements, hence O(n + n) which simplifies to O(n).
 Space Complexity:O(n) because, in the worst-case scenario, the frequency map might store the frequency of each distinct element in the input array, which could be n.

/*******  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ******************** 
 Given an array of n integers, find the sum of the frequencies of the highest occurring number and lowest occurring number.


 Examples:
 Input: arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

 Output: 4

 Explanation: The highest frequency is 3 (element 3), and the lowest frequency is 1 (element 1). Their sum is 3 + 1 = 4.

 Input: arr = [4, 4, 5, 5, 6]

 Output: 3

 Explanation: The highest frequency is 2 (elements 4 and 5), and the lowest frequency is 1 (element 6). Their sum is 2 + 1 = 3.

 Input: arr = [10, 9, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8]

 Output:
 4
 5
 ðŸŽ‰ Correct! Youâ€™ve earned 10 points!
 Constraints:
 1 <= n <= 105
 1 <= arr[i] <= 104
