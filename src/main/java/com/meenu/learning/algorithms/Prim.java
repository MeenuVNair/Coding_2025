/*******  APPROACH ******************** 

 Prim's algorithm is used to find a spanning tree with the minimum cost.
 Similar to Dijkstra, Prim's is also a greedy algorithm and works on weighted undirected graphs.

 What is a spanning tree? If we are given a graph G, a spanning tree is a subset of edges from G where the total weight of the edges is minimized.
 So, it is similar to Dijkstra in the sense of minimizing the cost.

 By definition a tree is a connected graph, the same is true for a minimum spanning tree.
 However, a tree cannot have any cycles. This means that if G has n nodes, our minimum spanning tree will have at most nâˆ’1 edges.
